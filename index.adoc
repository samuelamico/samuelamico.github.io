== Pixel Manipulation
The objective of this lesson is to show how we can manipulate the pixels of an image, for that we can access a pixel value by it's row and column coordinates. For BGR image, it returns an array of Blue,Green,Red values.For grayscale image, just corresponding intensity is returned.

* Negative of a Region of Interest (ROI)
In this example we'll be selecting a ROI with a specific coordinates that we give inside the program. The next step is invert the ROI, for this we use the simple formula: pixel_color_new = 255 - pixel_color_old. The image are in the grayscale.

.Biel image
image::biel.png[Biel,200,200]

.Negative image
image::negativebiel.png[Negative,200,200]

* Swapping regions
In this example we'll divided the image in four quadrants (they have the same dimension) - ROI A,B,C,D. Where each ROI are built from a copy of the original image, cv2.copy(). A new image will be construct by using those ROI, swapping them in differents ways.

.Biel image
image::biel.png[Biel,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

.Swapping image
image::bielmix.png[Swapping,200,200,float="left",align="center"]
